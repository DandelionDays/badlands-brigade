      <h2>Legends of the Bloodhounds</h2>
        <h3>ARMIS Anniversary 2024</h3>
        <p>A harrowing tale of the rise of the four-armed monster King Armada and the spread of corruption across the lands. Four intrepid bounty hunters are all that stand between South Elysium and utter annihilation by the scourge of Records Corruption.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Rumours have surfaced that ancient Legendary Artifacts capable of destroying corruption beasts were discovered in the Rugged Mountains, then lost again to corruption beast attacks. Can ARMIS recover the artifacts, defeat King Armada, and knock out some bounties along the way?</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Legends of the Bloodhounds: ARMIS Anniversary 2024</i> is a multi-part project incorporating the following aspects. <a href="bloodhounds-credits.html">Make sure to check out the credits</a> for details about our team members and where to find them!</p>

Ancient artifacts connected to the legendary Bloodhounds of old are uncovered by a team of scholars, yet lost again when they are attacked by corruption beasts.</p>
